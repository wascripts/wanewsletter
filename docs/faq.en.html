	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p1">I. How to display the number of subscribers on my site&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>To do this, simply insert the following code where you want to display the 
	number of subscribers (be carefull to put the right link to the <samp>extra.php</samp> 
	file)&#160;:</p>
	
	<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.yourdomaine.com/rep/options/extra.php?liste=[ID]"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
	
	<p>Replace <code class="constant">[ID]</code> by the ID number of the list of which you 
	want to display the number of subscribers.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p2">II. WAnewsletter, a multilingual script&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>Since our goal is to make WAnewsletter available to the largest audience,
	the script manages different languages. If you are fluent in a language in 
	which the script has not already been translated, and if you want to promote 
	WAnewsletter, simply download the package of your choice, translate it and send 
	it to  <a href="mailto:%77%61%73%63%72%69%70%74%73%40%70%68%70%63%6F%64%65%75%72%2E%6E%65%74">
	this email address</a>. The new language version will be made available for 
	downloading, after verification.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p3">III. How to be informed of a new version release&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>To be informed of a new version release, or newly found security failures 
	(possible&#8201;? :) ), visit the phpCodeur site every now and then, or 
	simply subscribe to the WAnewsletter mailing list 
	<a href="http://www.phpcodeur.net/wascripts/wanewsletter/mailing" hreflang="fr">here</a>.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p4">IV. How to import emails&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>An import utility is available  under the "Tools" header of the administration menu. 
	This utility will allow you, if you have proper rights, to import subscribers' 
	emails directly either through a text field, by specifying the address of the 
	emails file on the server, or by uploading a file  containing 
	the emails, providing your host allows file uploading.</p>
	
	<p>The import utility has been tested with mass imports of up to 2500 email 
	addresses (This should be sufficient). If not, you can divide to import 
	operation in as many smaller parts as necessary to make sure it works. Another 
	way to import more than 2500 email addresses in one shot consists 
	in modifying the value of the <code class="constant">MAX_IMPORT</code> constant 
	in the <samp>constantes.php</samp> files, but this is at your own risks&#8201;!</p>
	
	<p>The script will check each email address, and will remove  doubles. If emails 
	are rejected, the script will attempt to write a report file in its temporary 
	folder, which you then may download.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p5">V. How to have multiple users manage the script&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>WAnewsletter can be managed by multiple users. You can change the users' 
	permissions through each user's profile.</p>
	
	<p>There are two general levels&#160;: administrator and user. Administrators 
	have all rights automatically, whatever the settings on individual rights. 
	A user will be limited to granted rights (view, edit, delete, send, import,
	export, ban, and attach files) for each list.</p>
	
	<p>To add a user, go to the "Users" section and click on the "Add a user" button.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p6">VI. But where is the subscription form&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>There already is a default subscription form, the <samp>subscribe.php</samp> 
	file (users of versions 2.0.x or 2.1.x, please note that the name of that file 
	has changed because of its wrong spelling and  is therefore no longer 
	<samp>suscribe.php</samp>, so do not forget to change any links pointing to that file).
	The <samp>subscribe.php</samp> file displays a standard form, and a selection 
	list showing names of all created lists.</p>
	
	<p>The script also has a form generator in the tools section. This will allow
	you to generate an adequate form for any given list. You will then have to 
	place this generated form code where you want on your site, to place the 
	<samp>newsletter.php</samp> inclusion code (also created by the Form
	Generator) and to indicate in the list's settings the form's absolute address.</p>
	
	<p>One last solution (available from versions 2.2-RC1 and up) consists in having
	the visitor send an email to a list's address, with the word "Subscribe"
	(case	insensitive) on the subject line. In this case, you must have access to 
	cron (Unix servers or equivalent) or use the free services of 
	<a href="http://www.webcron.org/" hreflang="fr" title="Webcron: the automated task service">webcron.org</a> 
	to automate the call to the <samp>cron.php</samp> file located in the script's 
	<samp>options/</samp> folder. The script will undertake all necessary tasks 
	(subscription, unsubscription, format change, subscription confirmation, etc.) 
	according to received emails.</p>
	
	<p>To unsubscribe, the subscriber will have to send an email to the list's address
	with the word "Unsubscribe" on the subject line. He will then receive an email 
	asking for a reply with the same subject, his account code, which he will already 
	have. To confirm subscription (if the list is set to require it), the subscriber
	will have to send an email to the list with the word "confirmation" on the subject 
	line. To request a newsletter format change, the subject line will have to read 
	"setformat".</p>
	
	<p>If many of your distibution lists use the same email address, there is a
	risk of conflict, since the script will not be able to identify to which list 
	the <acronym title="Post Office Protocol">pop</acronym> account emails are 
	addressed. If such is the case, you will have to create an email alias on 
	your host's administration panel, if available (this excludes free hosting 
	servers). <em>Example&#160;:</em></p>
	
	<p>You have two lists using mailing@domain.com as email address.
	You will have to create two aliases forwarded to mailing@domain.com and specify
	these aliases in the settings of the lists, eg&#160;: mailing-1@domain.com and
	mailing-2@domain.com</p>
	
	<p>In the case of the "cron" option, you will have to specify the access parameters
	to the list's email adress's <acronym>pop</acronym> account and specify the use of the "cron" 
	option by clicking on the proper radio button, in the admin <b>Lists</b> section.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, cron will have to call an address of this type&#160;: 
	<kbd>http://www.yourdomain.com/rep/newsletter/options/cron.php?mode=validate&amp;liste=<code class="constant">[list_ID]</code></kbd>
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p7">VII. Why are there two send engines&#8201;?</h2>
	
	<p>In order to be  accessible to the largest number of users, WAnewsletter
	has two send engines. Some hosting services limit the number of emails sent 
	daily (ex: multimania/lycos), or only accept one recipient by email (ex: online).</p>
	
	<p>Using the fist engine (emails in hidden copy) gives a more  professionnal impression 
	(in my personal opinion). On the other hand, by using the second engine, 
	recipients will see ther email address in the "To" field. Also, the unsubscribe 
	address will contain the correct parameters, instead of simply pointing back 
	to the subscription/unsubscription form.</p>
	
	<p>In the end, it is up to you to choose the engine that suits you best&#160;;-)</p>
	
	<div class="note">
	<p><strong>Note&#160;:</strong>
	People hosted on "Online" <strong>must</strong> use the second engine (one subscriber
	= one email)
	</p>
	</div>
	P.S: 
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p8">VIII. Script's temporary folder, safe mode and open_basedir</h2>
	
	<p>The script's temporary folder, tmp/ by default, can be used by the script
	in some specific cases&#160;:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> If <code class="setting">safe mode</code> in activated on your server, 
		or if there is some restriction at the <code class="setting">open_basedir</code> 
		level, the script must move certain uploaded files in the <samp>tmp/</samp> 
		folder before reading them </li>
		<li> If you store attached files on a <abbr title="File Transfert Protocol">FTP</abbr> 
		server, the script must put them in the <samp>tmp/</samp> folder during 
		the sending process </li>
		<li> When exporting	 attached files, or backing up tables, if you
		choose the "store the file on the server" option, the script will create
		the file in the <samp>tmp/</samp> folder </li>
		<li>When importing email addresses, if some are rejected, the script will
		create the report file in the <samp>tmp/</samp> folder </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If one of theses cases applies to your situation (eg&#160;: <code class="setting">open_basedir</code>) 
	or you want to use some of the script's possibilities  (eg&#160;: storing the export
	file on the server), then the <samp>tmp/</samp> folder is necessary and must be writeable.</p>
	
	<p>The <samp>tmp/</samp> folder's name can be modified, provided you specify its new name
	in the <samp>admin/pagestart.php</samp> file (find the line&#160;: 
	<code>$tmp_name	   = 'tmp';</code> ).</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p9">IX. Cannot attach files to my newsletters&#8201;!</h2>
	
	<p>If file upload is authorized by your host, it might be caused by the script
	not having writing permissions on the attached files storage folder, or
	because the <abbr title="File Transfert Protocol">FTP</abbr> 
	server's access parameters are not properly set (if this option was chosen).
	Check the folder's chmod and/or attributes, or check the <abbr>FTP</abbr>'s 
	access parameters.</p>
	
	<p>If file upload is not authorized, the script adds the file to the list of
	attached files only if it is already on the server, in the attached files
	storage folder. Upload your attached files with your <abbr>ftp</abbr> client, 
	before adding them using the form.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p10">X. Using a smtp server to send emails</h2>
	
	<p>Unfortunately, using WAnewsletter's <abbr title="Simple Mail Transfert Protocol">SMTP</abbr> 
	option does not permit to send emails to recipients other than those whose 
	address is of the same domain as the <abbr>smtp</abbr> server's if you are 
	not identified as part of this domain. This is a <abbr>smtp</abbr> server 
	restriction (relay denial), not WAnewsletter.</p>
	
	<p><em>Example&#160;:</em><br />
	<br />
	You set <samp>smtp.wanadoo.fr</samp> as <abbr>smtp</abbr> server in the Wanewsletter 
	settings. If the <abbr>smtp</abbr> server does not identify you as being part 
	of the wanadoo domain, you will only be able to send emails to 
	<samp>blablabla@wanadoo.fr</samp> type addresses.</p>
	
	<p>The workaround is to have the <abbr>smtp</abbr> server that you want to use 
	manage the authentification, or in other words, that it recognizes the <kbd>AUTH LOGIN</kbd> 
	command (See the <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2554.txt" 
	hreflang="en"><abbr title="Request For Comments">RFC</abbr> 
	2554</a>). In this case, you can specify the server access login and password in the
	newsletter settings.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p11">XI. Calling the subscription form via a popup window</h2>
	
	<p>Integrating the subscription form to your site by calling it with a popup
	window is very simple. Here is the code&#160;:</p>
	
	<pre><code>&lt;a href="chemin_vers_dossier/subscribe.php" 
  onclick="window.open(this.href, 'mailing', 'width=400, height=300, topmargin=2, left=100, top=100, toolbar=0, location=0, directories=0, status=0, scrollbars=1, resizable=1, copyhistory=0, menuBar=0'); return false;"&gt;
  Newsletter
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
	
	<p>In each of the newsletter's settings, you must enter the absolute url to
	the form (eg&#160;: (http://yourdomain.com/rep/subscribe.php). However, 
	when a new subscriber clicks to confirm his subscription, or if
	he unsubscribes using the provided link in the newsletter, <samp>subscribe.php</samp>
	will appear on a full page.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p12">XII. Methods for email addresses  validation</h2>
	
	<p style="color: red;">This feature is unavailable in the version 2.2.5 and 
	next minor releases.</p>
	
	<p>
	To verify the validity of email addresses  provided for each subscription,
	the script verifies their syntactic validity.<br />
	Some characters cannot be present and email must contain the @ sign	 and
	a single dot for the domain name.<br />
	<br />
	You can adjust the script so that a more elaborate verification is done.
	(see	configuration)<br />
	<br />
	The more elaborate validation extracts the email's domain name,
	and then does	a	search	on it to verify that this domain does havel a <b>M</b>ail
	e<strong>X</strong>changer. <br />
	If it is the case, the script attempts to connect to the smtp server  (if
	the connection fails, the script will test the following smtp server...)
	then	sends	orders to simulate a sending.<br />
	If the smtp server accepts to achieve the sending (nothing is sent, the
	script won't end with the adequate order), the email belongs to its domain.<br />
	<br />
	This last verification is not however guaranteed at 100%.<br />
	Smtp Servers generally refuse an outside request	(the	script's	in
	this	case) to their domain for  sending	an email to an 
	address outside their domain, but this is not always
	the case.	(We speak
	in this
	case of a smtp server accepting the relaying). <br />
	<br />
	The best validation procedure remains the sending of an email to confirm
	the demand.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p13">XIII. Statistics directory name change</h2>
	
	<p>
	Changing the  tstats/ directory name is easy. Edit the functions.stats.php
	file and	find  the following line : <br />
	</p>
	
	<pre><code>define('WA_STATS_PATH'	   , $waroot . 'stats/', true); </code></pre>
	
	<p>
	Replace"stats" by the a name of your choice.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p14">XIV. Send newsletters with cron</h2>
	
	<p>
	The script allows you to send your newsletters with cron.<br />
	It's very simploe, just call the following address : <b>http://www.yourdomain.com/rep/</b>options/cron.php?mode=send&amp;liste=[ID] <br />
	<br />
	The part not put in bold is to be adjusted
	by	you.<br />
	Here also you must	 replace [ID] by the appropriate list id.<br />
	<br />
	Note: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> You can very well hange the name of the cron.php file. (recommended) </li>
		<li> It is up to you to adjust cron so that it achieves to calling to the
		script (if cron is not available on your server, you can use the
		free services  of<a href="http://www.webcron.org/" hreflang="fr" 
		title="Webcron: the automated task service"> webcron.org</a> )</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="p15">XV. Use personnalised tags</h2>
	
	<p>
	Pour utiliser les tags personnalisés (à l'instar de {LINKS} ou {NAME}), éditez le fichier tags.inc.php avec 
	un simple éditeur de texte. Vous devriez trouver ceci au début du fichier&#160;:
	</p>
	
	<pre><code><span class="hl-comment">//$other_tags&#91;$t&#93;&#91;'column_name'&#93; = '';
//$other_tags&#91;$t&#93;&#91;'tag_name'&#93;	 = '';
//$t++;
</span></code></pre>
	
	<p>
	Wanewsletter ne gère pas automatiquement les tags personnalisés. C'est à dire que c'est à vous de rajouter le 
	champs voulu dans la table <em>prefixe_</em>abonnes, puis de spécifier le tag dans tags.inc.php pour que 
	le script effectue le remplacement du tag par sa valeur lors de l'envoi.<br />
	<br />
	<em>Exemple&#160;:</em><br />
	<br />
	Vous souhaitez pouvoir mettre un tag {ADDRESS} dans vos newsletters, lequel sera remplacé par l'adresse de l'abonné. 
	Après avoir ajouté un champs nommé par exemple abo_address dans la table <em>prefixe_</em>abonnes, vous placerez 
	les données du tag dans tags.inc.php (en ayant décommenté les lignes que j'ai donné plus haut), comme ci dessous :
	</p>
	
	<pre><code><span class="hl-html"><span class="hl-default">$other_tags</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#91;</span><span class="hl-default">0</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#93;&#91;</span><span class="hl-string">'column_name'</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#93; = </span><span class="hl-string">'abo_address'</span><span class="hl-keyword">;
</span><span class="hl-default">$other_tags</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#91;</span><span class="hl-default">0</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#93;&#91;</span><span class="hl-string">'tag_name'</span><span class="hl-keyword">&#93;	 = </span><span class="hl-string">'ADDRESS'</span><span class="hl-keyword">; 
</span><span class="hl-default">$t</span><span class="hl-keyword">++;</span></span></code></pre>
	
	<p>
	Vous souhaitez maintenant ajouter un autre tag&#8201;? Reproduisez simplement la même opération.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Pour que vos abonnés puissent ajouter ces données dans leur profil, le panneau de gestion de profil doit être 
	activé (voir configuration générale). Vous devez modifier le template editprofile_body.tpl présent dasn le dossier 
	templates/ du script.<br />
	Ajoutez les champs text nécessaires en prenant soin de leur donner le nom de la colonne à laquelle il se rapporte.<br />
	<br />
	<em>Exemple en se basant sur les tags des exemples précédents :</em>
	</p>
	
	<pre><code>&lt;table class="content"&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td class="row1"&gt; &lt;label&gt;&#123;L_EMAIL&#125; :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class="row2"&gt; &lt;span class="texte"&gt;&#123;EMAIL&#125;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td class="row1"&gt; &lt;label for="pseudo"&gt;&#123;L_PSEUDO&#125; :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class="row2"&gt; &lt;input type="text" id="pseudo" name="pseudo" value="&#123;PSEUDO&#125;" size="30" maxlength="30" class="text" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	<span class="hl-html">&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td class="row1"&gt; &lt;label for="abo_address"&gt;Votre adresse :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class="row2"&gt; &lt;textarea id="abo_address" name="abo_address" rows="4" cols="50" class="text"&gt;&#123;ADDRESS&#125;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td class="row1"&gt; &lt;label for="abo_birthday"&gt;Anniversaire :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class="row2"&gt; &lt;input type="text" id="abo_birthday" name="abo_birthday" value="&#123;BIRTHDAY&#125;" size="30" maxlength="30" class="text" /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td class="row1"&gt; &lt;label for="language"&gt;&#123;L_LANG&#125; :&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td class="row2"&gt; &#123;LANG_BOX&#125; &lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;

	<p>
	This feature was asked by several users of Wanewsletter. <br />
	To define a language with the form (under reserve that this language is installed in Wanewsletter), 
	you just have to add the following line in the code of inclusion of newsletter.php which is supplied 
	by the generator of form&#160;:
	</p>
	
	<pre><code>
<span style="color: #0000BB;">$language </span><span style="color: #007700;">= </span><span style="color: #DD0000;">'francais'</span><span style="color: #007700;">;</span>
	</code></pre>
	
	<p>Note&#160;:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li> This code <strong>must</strong> be added before the inclusion of file newsletter.php (before <code>include()</code> ) </li>
	</ul>
